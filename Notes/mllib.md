VectorAssembler

| a    | b    | c    |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| v_11 | v_12 | v_13 |
| v_21 | v_22 | v_23 |

```python
from pyspark.ml.feature import VectorAssembler

vecAssembler = VectorAssembler(inputCols=["a", "b", "c"], outputCol="features")
```

After transformation, assuming `v_11`, `v_12`, `v_13`, `v_21`, `v_22`, `v_23` are numerical, your DataFrame might look like this:

| a    | b    | c    | features           |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ------------------ |
| v_11 | v_12 | v_13 | [v_11, v_12, v_13] |
| v_21 | v_22 | v_23 | [v_21, v_22, v_23] |

In the `features` column, each row contains a vector of the combined values from `a`, `b`, and `c` for that row.

In Spark, the `maxBins` parameter has a direct impact on the decision tree algorithm in several ways:

1. **Handling Continuous Features**: For continuous variables, `maxBins` determines how many distinct categories the data is divided into. A higher number of bins allows for a more precise split of the continuous feature but requires more computational resources and can lead to overfitting.
2. **Handling Categorical Features**: For categorical features, `maxBins` limits the number of categories that can be handled directly. If a categorical feature has more categories than `maxBins`, some categories may need to be grouped together, potentially reducing the model's accuracy. Therefore, having a sufficient number of bins is essential for effectively handling high-cardinality categorical features.

In Apache Spark's MLlib, feature importance for decision tree models (and tree ensemble models like RandomForest and GradientBoostedTrees) is computed based on the reduction in impurity achieved by each feature across all trees in the model. This approach aligns with the common practice in many tree-based machine learning frameworks and is designed to provide an intuitive understanding of how much each feature contributes to the model's predictions.

### Computing Feature Importance in Spark

Here’s a high-level overview of how feature importance is computed in Spark’s decision trees:

1. **Impurity Reduction**: For each node in a decision tree that splits on a particular feature, the algorithm calculates the reduction in impurity (such as Gini impurity for classification tasks or variance for regression tasks) achieved by that split.
2. **Aggregation**: For each feature, the algorithm sums up the reductions in impurity across all nodes in the tree where that feature was used to split the data. This sum represents the total contribution of the feature to improving the model's accuracy or reducing its error.
3. **Normalization**: The total reductions in impurity for each feature are then normalized so that the sum of all feature importances equals 1 (or 100% when expressed as percentages). This normalization allows for a comparison of feature importances across features on a consistent scale.
4. **Ensemble Models**: For ensemble models like RandomForest or GradientBoostedTrees, feature importances are averaged across all the trees in the ensemble. This gives a cumulative measure of each feature's importance across the entire model.

```python
l = zip(vecAssembler.getInputCols(), dtModel.featureImportances)
print(sorted(l, key = lambda x: x[1], reverse = True))
```

### Detailed Process of Distributed SGD

1. **Initialization**:
   - The dataset is distributed across multiple nodes in a cluster. Each node holds a partition of the data.
   - Initial model parameters (weights) are generated and broadcast to all nodes.

2. **Local Gradient Computation**:
   - Each node independently computes gradients based on its local data partition and the current model parameters. This step involves evaluating the loss function and its gradient for each instance or a mini-batch of instances.
   
3. **Gradient Aggregation**:
   - The gradients computed on each node are sent to a central node or aggregated through a distributed system (like a parameter server or using reduce operations).
   - These gradients can be aggregated by summing or averaging, as discussed previously.

4. **Parameter Update**:
   - The aggregated gradient is used to update the model parameters. This step often happens on a central node or in a distributed manner, depending on the architecture.
   - The updated model parameters are then broadcast back to all nodes in the cluster.

5. **Iteration**:
   - Steps 2-4 are repeated for a number of iterations or until convergence criteria are met (e.g., a specified number of iterations, minimal change in loss function, etc.).

6. **Finalization**:
   - Once training is complete, the final model parameters are gathered, and potentially a final model is constructed and made available for predictions or further analysis.
